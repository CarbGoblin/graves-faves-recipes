    <h3>Tofu Bahn Mi</h3>
    <p>A vegan bahn mi made with tofu marinated in soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice vinegar.</p>
    <p>We will prepare the carrots, onions, and jalapenos by pickling in a large mason jar 
        with sugar, white vinegar, and apple cider vinegar.</p>
    <p>Last we will make a delicious sauce to top it all with vegan mayonaise, sriracha, hoisin sauce, 
        and a splash of soy sauce.</p>
    <p>Put it all together on a fresh, warm baguette and your bahn mi is ready to go!</p>

        <li>1 block extra firm tofu</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Sesame oil</li>
        <li> 1Tbsp Rice vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Pickled Veggies</h4>

        <li>1 Jalapeno sliced in wheels</li>
        <li>1/2 Red onion sliced into thin strips</li>
        <li>3/4 Cup Sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 Cup White Vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>The Secret Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 Cup Vegan Mayonaise</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Sriracha</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Soy Sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain and press your block of tofu. I like to wrap mine in a clean hand towel and 
            sandwich it between two cutting boards with something with a bit of weight on top 
            to squeeze the excess liquid out. Let that press while you prepare the marinate.
        </li>
        <li>In a large ziploc bag combine the soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice vinegar.</li>
        <li>Slice your block of tofu into 1/2 inch thick slabs and gently place them in your 
            marinate. Take care to break them up as you're handling them.
        </li>
        <li>Set aside the tofu to marinate for at least an hour. Longer is better!</li>
        <li>Slice up your carrots, jalapeno, which may be seeded for less heat, and red onion and 
            add them all to a large, wide-mouth mason jar.</li>
        <li>Add in sugar, apple cider vinegar, and finally fill up the rest of the way with white 
            vinegar. There should be about 1/2 inch gap to the top of the jar. Pop on the lid and refridgerate 
            for at least an hour.
        </li>
        <li>Once the tofu has marinated, heat a pan over medium-high heat with 1 Tbsp of sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer a few pieces of the tofu at a time and fry them in the hot oil for about 
            7-8 minutes, flipping once partway through. They should be golden brown on both sides when done.
        </li>
        <li>Once all the tofu is cooked to crispy perfection, combine the sauce ingredients in a small dish and stir to mix.</li>
        <li>Slice your baguette and pile on the tofu, pickled veggies, and top with sauce!</li>
        <li>ENJOY!</li>

    </ol>
