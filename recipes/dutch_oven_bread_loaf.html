    <p>This is a super easy, beginner friendly bread thats great to try out on a cool fall day 
        or to compliment any soup or stew!
    </p>
    <p>With just a single hour to proof and only 4 ingredients, here is a bread recipe you won't need to plan days in advance!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 packet of activated dry yeast, 2 1/4 tsp</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>Thats it!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl, stir with a fork until a rough dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead with your hands on a lightly floured surface until a smooth dough forms, then return dough to a lightly oiled bowl.

        </li>
        <li>Cover the bowel with a slightly damp towel and place somewhere warm and free from drafts for 45 minutes to an hour, until dough doubles in size.</li>
        <li>During the last 10 minutes of proofing, place your dutch oven with the lid in the oven and pre-heat to 425F.</li>
        <li>Once dough has doubled in size, punch it down and knead a few more times.</li>
        <li>Very carefully remove your dutch oven from the hot oven and line with parchment paper, sprinking a little flour on the top and bottom of the dough then place in the dutch oven to cook!</li>
        <li>Replace the lid, then return the dutch oven to the oven to cook with the lid on for 35 minutes, then 10 more with the lid removed.</li>
        <li>Carefully take your dutch oven out, and remove your bread from the dutch oven. Let cool for 5-10 minutes and enjoy!</li>
