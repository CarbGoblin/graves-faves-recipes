    <h1>Claire Saffitz' Focaccia Recipe from "Dessert Person"</h1>
    <img src="../images/focaccia.jpg"/>
    <p>This recipe is a little time consuming, but it is pretty easy and even an inexperienced person 
        will get good results out of this recipe. It keeps for days in the fridge too. Since there are
        few ingredients it is good to try to use the best quality ingredients we can. Look for a nice
        olive oil especially since thats where this bread will get a lot of its flavor. For toppings,
        go wild!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 Cups Flour - I like to use bread flour, but all purpose is fine too</li>
        <li>2-3 Cups water</li>
        <li>1 packet of active dry yeast - 2 1/4 Tsp</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Proof the Yeast</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Pour 1/2 cup of warm (~100F) water in a large mixing bowl and add yeast</li>
            <li>Whisk to mix and let sit 5 mins until you see some activity. We're just
                looking for signs of life here, not necessarily lots of bubbling.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Add flour, salt, and the remaining water.</li>
        <li>Mix for 5 minutes. Start at a slow speed until flour is incorporated and then mix at medium speed.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let the dough rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix at medium speed for another 10-15 minutes until you see the dough begin to pull
            away from the sides of the bowl.
        </li>
        <li>In another bowl, add 1/4 cup olive oil and swirl around to coat all surfaces of the
            bowl. Add your dough, and use your hands to ensure the dough is coated in olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>Proof the dough for 1 to 2 hours. We are looking for the dough to double in size.
            Store somewhere warm, like inside the oven or microwave if possible. It will take longer to
            proof if it is colder. Use the poke test to check for a proper proof.
            During the proof I like to infuse about a 1/4 cup of olive oil with rosemary, a few cloves of
            garlic, and a pinch of red pepper flakes for our toppings later on.
        </li>
        <li>Use the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil to coat your half-sheet tray.</li>
        <li>Now before transferring the dough to the sheet we are going to perform a few folds.
            If you've ever made sour dough this will seem familiar. Lift the dough from the middle, letting
            the edges stretch down towards the bowl. Fold it back down into the bowl, then rotate the bowl 
            90 degrees and repeat until you've turned the bowl all the way around twice. Once finished
            with the folds, place the dough on the sheet tray.
        </li>
        <li>Gently stretch the dough until it starts to spring back. This is our cue to let it rest
            for another 10 minutes. The dough is going to be pretty sticky, so it helps to use some of
            the excess olive oil in the tray to oil a sheet of plastic wrap and cover the dough while it rests.
        </li>
        <li>Finish stretching the dough to the edges of the tray. 
        </li>
        <li>Proof your dough a second time, this time for 45 to 55 minutes, covering with the oiled
            plastic wrap. Preheat the oven to 450F during the last 10 minutes of this proof.
        </li>
        <li>Now its time to dimple the bread. This step gives us the nice bubbly surface that we're 
            looking for here. Spread that garlic rosemary infused olive oil over your dough now and 
            add any other toppings you want as well.
        </li>
        <li>Bake on the bottom rack of your oven for 20-25 minutes, then move it up to the top rack 
            for an additional 5 minutes to get the top nice and crispy.
        </li>
        <li>Let cool for 5-10 minutes and serve.</li>
    </ol>
